# three-js-voodoo

Hey there! Here's my technical test. I decided to reproduce a short version of Flip Dunk. Here are my main insights from this experience:

# The pros

- Learning Three.js and Blender in one week was very intense but super interesting! Exploring and reading about a lot of new tools (Mixamo, Physijs...) was very
  rewarding as it is a totally new world for me. I'm glad I could build a mini-game in that amount of time
- I made 3 levels in the game, and made a small path for the user

# The struggles

- As I have no prior experience in Blender nor Three.js, it took me quite some time to read documentation and watch tutorials. The most frustrating part were the struggles I encountered with the FBX files: I did not manage to work with them so I exported them under gltf. Also, it took me some time to combine them all together, so that one model would have all the relevant animations.
- I had big problems with the "Tuck" animation, which was essential to make the flip, as it seemed bugged to me, or at least I did not know which adjustments I could do in Blender to fix it. I tried to import new animation from Mixamo and combine it with the existing, but it was unsuccessful
- The lack of time (as I'm fully working during the week) stopped me from exploring Textures and more specific 3D matters
- My touchpad died along the way, unabling me to test the final mobile version

# The features I added

- I cheated a bit as I made the player start at the right location for the user to be able to dunk at least. But I added key press in case we make the player start from somewhere else, so it would be more difficult for the user as s.he would have to place the player before starting the game

# Features I would add

- I would add some defence players as the game goes harder that would appear randomly, forcing the user to flip + dunk at the right moment
- I would add some birds that could change the trajectory of the ball to make it more impredictable
- I would add some music to make it more fun for the user
- My starting animation would be something dribbling

Thank you for reading me.
